                    <h1>Policy On Revisions:</h1>
                    <p>Depending on your selected package, you are entitled to up to three revisions. Customers may request an unlimited number of free modifications, and we are happy to revise their design at no additional charge as long as the core design and concept remain unchanged. However, exceeding the allotted number of revisions will result in additional design and development costs. (Fair usage policy applies)</p>
                    <h1>Money-Back Guarantee / Refund Policy:</h1>
                    <p>In any case, any funds deposited for a project are not refundable after completion until the original design proposals are approved or a modification is demanded unless The canvasillustrationss cancels or terminates the Contract for a reason other than your violation or non-performance.</p>
                    <h1>Refund Policy / Money Back Guarantee:</h1>
                    <p>- In any event, any deposited funds for a project shall not be subject to refund after delivery if the initial design concepts are approved, or you request changes in the initial mockup then the refund offer becomes void and the refund request will not be entertained.</p>
                    <p>- All refund requests will be fulfilled as per the following arrangement: You make a request when the initial concepts for a logo are offered. However, once you approve or request changes in the initial designs, the refund offer becomes void and the refund request will not be entertained.</p>
                    <p>- If a request for refund is made before the delivery of initial design concepts, then you would be eligible for a Full Refund (10% service & processing fee will apply).</p>
                    <p>- If a request for a refund is made within 48 hours, you would be eligible for a 50% refund (10% service & processing fee will apply).</p>
                    <p>- If a request for a refund is made between 48-120 hours of the initial design delivery, you would be eligible for a 33% refund (less 10% service & processing fee).</p>
                    
                    <p>- No refund request will be entertained after 120 hours of your initial design delivery. However, since we believe in 100% customer satisfaction, you're encouraged to contact us in case of any concerns.</p>
                    <p>- No refund request will be entertained if you have not taken any action on your order for 10 days after placing your order. However, if you want to reactivate your design order, you will be charged a certain fee depending on your project.</p>
                    <p>- If the client remains unresponsive or fails to actively participate in the project for more than 5 days, we reserve the right to consider the project suspended. This would require us to initiate the necessary steps to stop the project and may result in additional reactivation fees.</p>
                    <p>- No refund requests will be entertained after the final files have been delivered. For website packages, no refund will be entertained once website development has been completed or once the website has been deployed live.</p>
                    <p>- For video animation packages, no refund request will be entertained after the design of the storyboard.</p>
                    <p>- No refund request will be entertained for Hosting, SSL, TLS, SEO, Content Writing, and Social Media Services.</p>

                    <p>- For canvasillustrations/Custom packages, a refund will be applicable the same as it is on the single packages.</p>
                    <p>- For example, if you order logo and web design service and approve the logo, you can claim a refund for the website service at the time of initial design only.</p>
                    <p>- All refund requests should be communicated to the support department. canvasillustrations, based on the violation of your user agreement, reserves the right to approve/disapprove your request on an individual case-to-case basis.</p>
                    <p>- A refund request will need to have a valid reason which must be qualified against the design brief and customer feedback for revisions. Unless a concept has not been designed according to the brief, a refund will not be given, however, further revisions will be provided until complete satisfaction. Money back guarantee is based on the order being placed in good faith. Where a customer has placed design orders with more than one design agency for the same job with the intention to claim a refund, we do not consider it good faith. In such a case, we reserve the right to decline a refund request. All design jobs require customer feedback before finalizing the design; therefore, it is only fair that the customer gets involved and provides feedback to get the desired results. 100% unique design guarantee entitles you to a re-draw if our designed logo is found to be considerably similar to another logo design that may already exist. Any resemblance to an existing design will be merely a coincidence, and canvasillustrations will not accept any responsibility or claim of any compensation in such a case.</p>
